/**
 * @brief Documentation for pthread_detach function
 * 
 * pthread_detach() marks the thread specified by thread as detached.
 * When a detached thread terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system
 * without the need for another thread to join with it.
 * 
 * prototype: int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
 * 
 * @param thread The thread ID to detach
 * @return 0 on success, error code on failure
 */

/**
 * @brief Thread Detachment Demo
 * 
 * This program demonstrates the difference between:
 * 1. Detached threads (automatically release resources when they finish)
 * 2. Joinable threads (must be explicitly joined to release resources)
 * 
 * @note Compilation: gcc -pthread pthread_detach.c
